I'm [Tom Magrino](http://tommagrino.com), a PhD student in Computer Science at
Cornell University, advised by [Andrew Myers](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru).
I'm interested in topics relating to distributed computing, programming
languages, and security.

I started this blog because:
  - I remember and read more papers if I write about them.
  - I needed an excuse to write more regularly.
  - I'm hoping to generate discussions with others with similar interests.
